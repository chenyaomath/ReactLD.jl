# ReactLD.jl

This Julia package aims at performing stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) of particle-based **reactive Brownian and Langevine dynamics**.

## Support and citation
If you use this package for your work, we ask that you cite the following paper. Open source development as part of academic research strongly depends on this. Please also consider starring this repository if you like our work, this will help us to secure funding in the future.
